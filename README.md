# MARS ROVER EXERCISE

This is a python 3 program that simulates the movement of a rover in a user defined grid system.

It takes the current location, direction and movement instructions as input and gives the final rover location and direction in the grid as output.

First user has to define the 2D grid which only takes positive integers as input. The rover wil not exceed the grid limit

Then user has to define the current location of the rover followed by the direction its facing in a single line.

The current location must be valid and cannot exceed the grid limit.

The direction must be either N, E, S or W (non case sensitive). Example input field: "2 2 W".

Lastly the user must enter the number of obstacles in the grid and the co ordinate of each obstacle. The rover cannot enter the co ordinate in which an obstacle is present and sends an alert, ignoring the respective move instruction.

The program will then give the status report as output which contains the current location and its direction.
